# magic-cube-leapmotion

A virtual magic cube controlling by hands with **Leap Motion**.

## Motivation
We made this during a Hackathon in Shanghai, hoping to simulate the experience of playing a magic cube in reality.
By moving your hands through the air, you can easily rotate the cube and position the pieces. </br>
Though it is just a rough demo, hope you enjoy it.

See the [project profile](https://www.hackx.org/projects/71).
